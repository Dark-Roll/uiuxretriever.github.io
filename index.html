我剛 讀完 Rian van der Merwe 的書, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22811444-making-it-right" class="de iq" rel="noopener nofollow"><em class="jp">Making it Right: Product Management in a Startup World</em></a>. It’s a toolkit of techniques for planning and designing software products.</p>

<p id="09db" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Though it boasts the word “startup” right in the title and provides a bit of content tailored to that audience, don’t pass it by simply because you’re not in Silicon Valley. I enjoyed reading it, and I work at a three-decades-old engineering company.</p>

<p id="7989" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
As the saying goes, teaching <span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm">a</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> topic is the best way to learn it. This post summarizes and comments on the book’s parts that struck me as particularly intriguing or innovative. Hopefully, my ramblings will sear the information into my grey matter. I hope you get something out of them, too.</p>

<p id="85ca" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
On that note, if these notes interest you, I do recommend reading the full book. I cover a mere fraction of the text’s topics here, and those tidbits from the book I glossed over might tickle your fancy.</p>

<p id="207d" class="ir is fm it b iu km iw ix iy kn ja jb jc ko je jf jg kp ji jj jk kq jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Some books center on a single premise. They make an argument upfront and spend the rest of their pages elaborating and supporting it. <em class="jp">Making it Right</em> does not.</p>

<p id="52f4" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Instead, van der Merwe takes his readers through a buffet of advice, letting the audience choose which lessons to learn. As an introduction to the profession, I prefer it this way. Product management in the tech industry is diverse and dynamic. Thus I am skeptical of all-encompassing theories about <em class="jp">How to Do Things</em>. Experience is the best teacher here. Offering a range of recommendations in self-contained lessons lets the reader pluck an idea and apply it to the task at hand.</p>

<p id="93e2" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
In that spirit, I do not attempt sweeping observations about the book. Instead, this post presents a list of axioms that occurred to me as I read the material, elaborating as it goes. Does such a structure fit the “listicle” moniker? I suppose so. But here, the format meets our needs.</p>

<p id="ef4d" class="ir is fm it b iu km iw ix iy kn ja jb jc ko je jf jg kp ji jj jk kq jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I once heard an agile coach announce that the most critical word in a product owner’s vocabulary is the word “no.” As in, “no, we’re not adding another feature right now. No, we’re not upgrading our coding libraries right now.”</p>

<p id="593f" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
The word “no” exists to give focus to a company’s product development efforts.</p>

<p id="0fdc" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
After reading van der Merwe’s book, I think he would agree. He advises companies to focus on their target market’s needs and goals and not chase technology fads or solutions that don’t fit the audience. Narrow the lens.</p>

<p id="b3be" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
He backs up his advice with research showing that market-driven companies are 31% more profitable than those that are not.</p>

<p id="a75f" class="ir is fm it b iu km iw ix iy kn ja jb jc ko je jf jg kp ji jj jk kq jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
It’s trendy these days to talk about T-shaped people. In essence, one should master a specialty (the vertical bar of the T) while knowing just enough from a smattering of related topics (the horizontal bar of the T). Combine depth with breadth.</p>

<p id="bce7" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
<em class="jp">Making it Right</em> gives the concept a different spin: Product managers should strive for the shape of a capital “I.” One can be visionary and flexible (the top bar) while also knowing details and how to deliver (the bottom bar).</p>

<p id="65fc" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I would take the idea further and argue that these two orientations are useful at different times in a project. Strategic thinking and defining a vision lend themselves to the earlier phases of designing a product, such as exploring user needs. Pragmatism and a bias for completion, on the other hand, are essential as deadlines loom and execution is a must.</p>

<p id="c0ed" class="ir is fm it b iu km iw ix iy kn ja jb jc ko je jf jg kp ji jj jk kq jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Consensus isn’t necessarily harmful, according to van der Merwe. But making it the primary goal of a design process often leads to diluted, boring products. Endless compromise wears down the original idea and demoralizes teams.</p>

<p id="9ea9" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Collaboration, on the other hand, preserves a clear vision. Everyone gets a voice, but decisions remain within the product manager’s purview. Not everyone will agree. But as long as they trust the decision-maker, they won’t mind.</p>

<p id="85bf" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
For this approach to work, the author points out that management must establish a company-wide understanding that the product manager calls the shots. If executives don’t develop that vision, product managers can become powerless and frustrated.</p>

<p id="d5af" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I’ve noticed another problem with consensus-first cultures, which the book doesn’t cover: endless debate. If two people in a design discussion have strong opinions and stick to them, you might be there a while. I have seen these conversations drag on for weeks and still not end in agreement. A single person with the authority to adopt a solution — and who isn’t afraid to use it — can prevent such torture.</p>

<p id="071e" class="ir is fm it b iu km iw ix iy kn ja jb jc ko je jf jg kp ji jj jk kq jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
<em class="jp">Making it Right</em> points out the pitfalls of closed communication. Keeping loose research notes in a Word file on your laptop might be faster than curating a company wiki page. That easy road, however, keeps information away from teammates.</p>

<p id="4bb4" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Instead, work out in the open. If your documents might inform your colleagues’ thoughts and plans, make them available to everyone in your company at all times. Communication will likely improve since everyone will have the facts at their fingertips.</p>

<p id="5f6b" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Public documentation of findings, sketches, and plans has another benefit. The author didn’t discuss it, but that’s not surprising given his emphasis on the startup environment. When iterating on software products that have been around for a few years, there’s a natural tendency to forget the reasoning behind a particular design.</p>

<p id="d779" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Team members come and go. People move back and forth between projects. We shouldn’t assume the knowledge driving a decision today will be around in a few years when it’s time to iterate on an existing feature.</p>

<p id="b766" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Publishing your notes in a public space that is easy to find helps to ward off organizational forgetfulness. If new folks come on board a year from now, that’s okay. They can read the background documentation to understand why the product is the way it is.</p>

<p id="e4a0" class="ir is fm it b iu km iw ix iy kn ja jb jc ko je jf jg kp ji jj jk kq jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
In business, saying that revenue can harm you is like saying up is down. But our author points out that dwindling income from a dying product can attach a company to an outdated offering, missing opportunities to catch bigger fish.</p>

<p id="b44e" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
He tells how eBay had grown attached to charging a fee for allowing photos in its listings. The money was nice, but they didn’t realize that encouraging their customers to upload pictures would improve their platform’s rankings in search engines. When they finally switched to hosting photos for free, they lost a bit of secondary revenue. Still, they gained much more from the increased popularity of their core service.</p>

<p id="1b75" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
The book boasts that the best way to solve the problem is to use research to demonstrate how much the firm stands to gain by cutting off the toxic revenue stream.</p>

<p id="a8f5" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Besides addiction to existing income, I think the sunk cost fallacy plays a role in this problem. Engineering organizations often pour a ton of resources into building products. Some employees might stake their reputations on them. A manager in that situation might try to salvage their project based on a personal survival instinct.</p>

<p id="3ff2" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Perhaps one way to avoid such clinging is to compliment people for building things well in the past, even if it isn’t the right thing to make anymore.</p>

<p id="40f3" class="lj lk fm as ll lm ln lo lp lq lr jo eu" data-selectable-paragraph="">
“If I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.” Albert Einstein</p>

<p id="6220" class="ir is fm it b iu ls iw ix iy lt ja jb jc lu je jf jg lv ji jj jk lw jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Van der Merwe provides this quote to highlight a point: Tech folks often jump straight into crafting the solution.</p>

<p id="964e" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Take the famous phrase “minimum viable product,” for example. Our author takes issue with the word “viable.” Product managers typically use the term to describe the minimum set of features necessary to make a product work. The team should release the product once they reach that threshold.</p>

<p id="c439" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
But “viable” does not mean “desirable.” Yes, the thing might work. But do people want it? Does it solve their problems?</p>

<p id="7f38" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Thus van der Merwe recommends the phrase “minimum desirable product” instead. The slight shift in emphasis calls attention to the user’s needs. If a product doesn’t fit its target market, then you have a well-crafted offering that no one wants. Thus we must take the time to frame the problem before solving it.</p>

<p id="3715" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I agree with the book here and suggest a root cause: developers typically master building things, not selling them.</p>

<p id="348f" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
In my bachelor’s degree in computer science, I took a single course in studying users’ needs. All other classes focused on programming. I’m not saying such strict emphasis on coding is inappropriate, just that it doesn’t teach developers much about the business side of their craft.</p>

<p id="0835" class="ir is fm it b iu km iw ix iy kn ja jb jc ko je jf jg kp ji jj jk kq jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
A story is a time-honored medium for communicating, even in the tech industry. Agile folks know this from the omnipresent user story. <em class="jp">Making it Right</em> shows us how to apply that principle to get across the essentials of a user’s problem.</p>

<p id="b6dc" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Enter the problem story: [user] has [problem] when [trigger]. Notice it doesn’t describe the solution like a user story does. Instead, it focuses on the need. The format concisely defines the target user, the problem to be solved, and under what circumstance the problem occurs.</p>

<p id="240b" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
After presenting such a problem story, a product manager can provide enough of the problem’s context to guide the design.</p>

<p id="5f2b" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I like the problem story as an executive summary of a larger body of research. I’ve often written pages detailing customers and users’ needs, only to find that my colleagues haven’t read them. I’ve had more success when summarizing the essentials.</p>

<p id="ef17" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
The source material, however, comes in handy when someone disputes my summary. Then, since the person is engaged, the opportunity has arrived to cover the topic in depth.</p>

<p id="478d" class="ir is fm it b iu km iw ix iy kn ja jb jc ko je jf jg kp ji jj jk kq jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I’m going to guess that just about everyone in the tech industry has at least heard of Agile, even if they’re not fully practicing it. The author cautions Agile practitioners to note that being nimble and iterative is not an excuse to stop planning or crafting a long-term vision.</p>

<p id="f83a" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Agile product managers must still select a target market and identify problems to solve. Products need a direction, even if that direction changes a bit from sprint to sprint as more information becomes available.</p>

<p id="7b18" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Furthermore, while Agile fosters iteration, it doesn’t provide for variation. When should we scrap a product or take it in a radically new direction? The Agile product owners’ toolkit — such as grooming the backlog and writing user stories — doesn’t answer these questions. Thus the traditional emphasis of product managers still has value here.</p>

<p id="544d" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
As an Agile product owner myself, I agree that we should view the role as distinct from product management. Product ownership is more tactical, focusing on implementing a provided product strategy and explaining that implementation to development teams.</p>

<p id="c97c" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
While a product owner can be the product manager, when she isn’t, she needs insight into the product’s vision to do her job well.</p>

<p id="eb85" class="ir is fm it b iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
As I mentioned at the start, I’ve only covered a smattering of the insights in Rian van der Merwe’s<em class="jp"> </em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22811444-making-it-right" class="de iq" rel="noopener nofollow"><em class="jp">Making It Right: Product Management For A Startup World</em></a>. You will find quite a few more by reading the book itself. I highly recommend it.</p>

再一個月 we will (finally!) say goodbye to the not-so-cool year 2020. Since <a class="de ki" rel="noopener" href="/10-newest-and-promising-ui-design-trends-929562b25ad6">my previous article about trends</a> was quite successful, I took some time and did some industry research, to create a 2021 Design Trend Guide.</p>

Have you heard about the newest craze called <strong class="jo fn">glassmorphism</strong>? (that’s right, neuomorphism is no longer cool). It’s the newest trend in UI, which is mostly based on a effect called <strong class="jo fn">background blur</strong>, and it basically creates that “through the glass” look and feel on elements.</p>

<p id="4fdc" class="jm jn fm jo b gl jp jq jr go js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
It was introduced in Windows Vista, then later in iOS7, but it seems it’s here to stay for a bit in the new, refreshed form! If you want to take a closer look at glassmorphism, try this <a href="https://glassmorphism.com/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Glassmorphism Generator</a> online tool and see Mike’s article about it:</p>

<p id="50a1" class="jm jn fm jo b gl lw jq jr go lx jt ju jv ly jx jy jz lz kb kc kd ma kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I strongly predict that soon everybody will be tired of illustrations and 3D graphics in product design, so real-life photos will make a huge comeback.</p>

<p id="4cb8" class="jm jn fm jo b gl jp jq jr go js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
As I wrote in one of my previous articles, illustrations might not be for everybody. And sometimes real people and real items can make a bigger impact on users. <a href="https://ekokubki.pl/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Ekokubki’s</a> website is based on a real-life photography and it looks great!</p>

I love how colors create a magical, ethereal vibe there. <strong class="jo fn">And when we use vivid colors, it’s easier for us to differentiate and remember a product</strong>. Instagram knew that a long time ago (and that’s why the unforgettable change of their icon took place).</p>

Similar to the one above, but mixed with glassmorphism a bit… Thanks to the delicacy of this effect, I think it makes the UI look just pleasurable to look at. The designs that use blurred backgrounds look incredibly organic, warm and welcoming.</p>

Take a look at <a href="https://stripe.com/en-pl?utm_campaign=paid_brand-PL_en_Search_Brand_Stripe-6492221267&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;ad_content=381612492120&amp;utm_term=stripe&amp;utm_matchtype=e&amp;utm_adposition=&amp;utm_device=c&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAwrf-BRA9EiwAUWwKXtsYb18Pr-r1xcaD4R3TKePsuRcXswSdVpAbABfE0FNBcwnK2hmX1BoCsLIQAvD_BwE" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Stripe</a> (also some glassmorphism there) and <a href="https://mymind.com/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">My Mind</a> (an amazing, simple tool for self-organization).</p>

Probably a trend I personally love the most. There’s nothing more aesthetically pleasing, than a simple, minimal and readable UI.</p>

<p id="9e0a" class="jm jn fm jo b gl jp jq jr go js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Websites like <a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-PL/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Revolut</a> (also simple 3D), <a href="https://www.sketch.com/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Sketch</a> and <a href="https://qoals.com/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Qoals</a> (also blurred background) are the perfect example that you don’t need a fancy UI, or “wow effects” for your product to look absolutely astounding (sadly, not many clients understand that).</p>

<p id="9a1f" class="jm jn fm jo b gl lw jq jr go lx jt ju jv ly jx jy jz lz kb kc kd ma kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I’m seeing more and more designs that have a very tidy, conservative visual structure. It makes the information looks really sorted out!</p>

<p id="115b" class="jm jn fm jo b gl jp jq jr go js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
One of the most beautiful examples of geometric structure of the interface is <a href="https://www.rituals.com/en-us/precious-amber-scented-candle-1109604.html?source=cop&amp;showbacklink=false#start=1" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Rituals</a> website. Such a pleasure to use and look at (also, love the simple but enjoyable animations).</p>

<p id="28b0" class="jm jn fm jo b gl lw jq jr go lx jt ju jv ly jx jy jz lz kb kc kd ma kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
There’s a lot of examples of a big, sophisticated typography playing the main role in a design of a product. Some of them are even entirely based on a typography — and the result is often interesting. The choice of a typeface is often quite extravagant.</p>

<p id="4da0" class="jm jn fm jo b gl jp jq jr go js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Take a look at <a href="https://whirlybirdie.com/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Whirly Birdie</a>, <a href="https://dovetailstudios.com/the-story-of-dovetail-and-afterpay/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Dovetail+Afterpay</a> (also vivid colors) and <a href="https://synchronized.studio/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Synchronized</a> (also brutalism).</p>

<p id="e1c2" class="jm jn fm jo b gl lw jq jr go lx jt ju jv ly jx jy jz lz kb kc kd ma kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
This is a trend that I have the most problem with (maybe not so much as with neuomorphism, to be honest). It’s called brutalism and it looks quite as the name suggests — strong contrasts, often unpleasant typography and many problems with the accessibility and readability. But I get the overall vibe — <strong class="jo fn">the main idea behind it is basically a deconstruction of what we perceive as beautiful and useful</strong>.</p>

<p id="da5e" class="jm jn fm jo b gl jp jq jr go js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
Surprisingly, I’m seeing many websites and apps actually pursuing this trend! (one of it being a polish radio station called <a href="https://newonce.net/" class="de ki" rel="noopener nofollow">Newonce</a>).</p>

<p id="32ad" class="jm jn fm jo b gl jp jq jr go js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I really tried but I am not a fan of it when it comes to UI. I would prefer it to stay on posters and in magazines.</p>

<p id="7973" class="jm jn fm jo b gl lw jq jr go lx jt ju jv ly jx jy jz lz kb kc kd ma kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
A trend different than the others — not visual in any way.</p>

<p id="2f78" class="jm jn fm jo b gl jp jq jr go js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
I’m seeing that more and more people in the industry are realizing that many processes behind product design has become extremely overcomplicated. It’s here and it’s bad — for product designers, for clients, and mostly — for the digital products itself.</p>

<p id="203c" class="jm jn fm jo b gl jp jq jr go js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ff gj" data-selectable-paragraph="">
<strong class="jo fn">There’s a huge need for a change. </strong>And, I believe it’s slowly starting to change. I strongly think that it’s time to take a few steps back, or to look at the whole industry with a fresh eye. It’s time to rethink the confusing concepts and names, rebuild the difficult and time consuming processes and make it easier for the aspiring designers to learn product design.</p>
